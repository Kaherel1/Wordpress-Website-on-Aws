Hosted Wordpress Website on AWS

  I recently finished a DevOps project where I hosted a static html web app on AWS, utilizing the resources
listed below. I have uploaded the reference diagram and scripts I used to deploy the web app on an EC2
instance to a GitHub repository for the project. Please use this information to create a readme file for
the project.
